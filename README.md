`Subtitle Torrent Episode Downloader` (or `sted` for short) is a simple Java
desktop application based on Swing Application Framework to check periodically
for torrents and subtitles for tv show files that are in a specified directory.

**Note**: This application is inspired by `ted` (Torrent Episode Downloader)
and has the goal to provide a simpler and unified solution to retrieve torrents
and their subtitles in only one application. This project is in a very initial
stage and never saw the light of day.

## Usage

If you want to execute the pre-compiled version you can do it by issuing the
following commands:

```shell
make create-release
cd release
java -jar sted.jar
```
