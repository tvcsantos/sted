    <td colspan="4"><h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>Heroes is a serial saga about people all over the world discovering  that they have superpowers and trying to deal with how this change  affects their lives. Some of the superheroes who will be introduced to  the viewing audience include Peter Petrelli, an almost 30-something  male nurse who suspects he might be able to fly, Isaac Mendez, a  28-year-old junkie who has the ability to paint images of the future  when he is high, Niki Sanders, a 33-year-old Las Vegas showgirl who  begins seeing strange things in mirrors, Hiro Nakamura, a 24-year-old  Japanese comic-book geek who literally makes time stand still, D.L.  Hawkins, a 31-year-old inmate who can walk through walls, Matt Parkman,  a beat cop who can hear other people's thoughts, and Claire Bennet, a  17-year-old cheerleader who defies death at every turn. As the viewing  audience is discovering the nature of each hero's powers, the heroes  themselves are discovering what having superpowers means to them as  well as the larger picture of where their superpowers come from. Tune  in each week to see how these heroes are drawn together by their common  interest of evading the series' antagonist who wants to harvest their  super-DNA for himself. Their ultimate destiny is nothing less than  saving the world!
